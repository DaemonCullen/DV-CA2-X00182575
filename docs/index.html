                      Gaelscoil Faithleann was where I went to primary school as
                      a kid and it is located in the centre of Kerry. It is a
                      small irish speaking school in the town of Killarney and
                      has been open since 1989 as a result of a joint working
                      group of local parents and members of Conradh na Gaeilge.
                      The schools logo is a branch with three sloes that
                      represent the three lakes in Killarney. The uniform is
                      purple to represent the colour of the sloe fruit.

                      Adamstown Community College (ACC) is where I went to
                      school when I moved back to Dublin. It is located on
                      Finnstown, Lucan, directly beside the train station and
                      has over a thousand students. In ACC I took many different
                      classes such as metalwork, technology, biology and of
                      course computer science.

                <p>
                  Over the years of computer programming I have picked up a
                  couple different programming languages. First is
                  <strong class="highlight">HTML/CSS</strong> which is one of my
                  favourites as it let's you create art as well as software.
                  Because of my love of these languages I have also picked up a
                  little <strong class="highlight">Javascript</strong> to make
                  those website a little more interactive and alive. Another big
                  language for me is
                  <strong class="highlight">Python</strong> as it was the first
                  language I learned and I used it in my secondary school so it
                  is one I am well acquainted with. Another language I love is
                  <strong class="highlight">C++/C#</strong> because growing up
                  loving games the C languages were always ones I liked because
                  of what they have created. The final language I have just
                  started learning is
                  <strong class="highlight">Dart/Flutter</strong>. I may not
                  have a much experience with Dart but it is what I am creating
                  my final year project with and I have found it to be
                  fantastic.

                  Throughout my life wheater it was working on projects with
                  people, making something alone or just doing my own thing I
                  have deffinitly picked up my fair share of usefull soft skills
                  along with my technical skills. One easy one is
                  <strong class="highlight">Creativity</strong> which comes from
                  my love of art. The big one is deffinitly my
                  <strong class="highlight">Problem Solving</strong> which has
                  always been a strong suit of mine wheater it's figuring out
                  how to fix something or how make something more effeicent.
                  Another one has been a big part in how I work is of course
                  <strong class="highlight">Teamwork</strong>. Working with all
                  sorts of people over the years has deffinitly thought me just
                  how important communication and cooperation is.

                  Although it may not be completed I thought that my final year
                  college project was an important one to talk about. My project
                  named Passenger is an mobile application designed for bikers.
                  It uses a phones sensors to graph and chart lateral and
                  longitudinal g-forces in real time to teach bikers about the
                  limits of their vehicle. This is an important one for me as
                  someone raised around bikers I have seen my fair share of
                  crashes and worse because bikes can be deadly if not handled
                  correctly. So the app can show a rider where the limits are by
                  viewing their g-forces compared to a limit.

                      As someone who was born and raised in a family of bikers
                      both casual and racers it was always inevitable that I was
                      going to fall in love with motorbikes. From the moment I
                      first sat on and drove my dads Yamaha R1 when I was a kid
                      I fasinated with bikes. When I was nineteen I got my first
                      bike which was a Honda CBF250 and was unbeievalbly loud
                      and light. Although it wasn't the fastest motorbike it was
                      my first time driving leagelly on the road and it was
                      great. A few years later I sold it and got a Yamaha XV535
                      Virago. After a while of driving that I also picked up a
                      Honda NX500 as the Virago is on its way out and needs a
                      lot of work.

                      For as long as I can remember I have always loved making
                      things, and since I have always loved computers I ended up
                      learning how to create art using Blender in secondary
                      school and have continued to make things since. I have
                      always been fasinated by the power that Blender and other
                      software has to create beautiful things. I have even used
                      it for making certain things in code such as effects on
                      HTML websites.
